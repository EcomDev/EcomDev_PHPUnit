Magento PHPUnit Integration
===========================

Magento is a quite complex platform without built in unit test suite, so the code is not oriented on running tests over it.

This extension was created especially for resolving this problem and promoting test driven development practices in Magento developers community. It doesn't change core files or break your Magento installation database. All system objects are replaced during run-time with the test objects, and a separate database connection is used for tests.

* PHP 5.3 or higher
* PHPUnit 3.7.x
* Magento CE1.4.x-1.7.x/PE1.9.x-PE1.10.x/EE1.9.x-1.12.x

Installation
------------


1. There are two ways of obtaining the extension:    
    * Use [Module Manager](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) 
        
     ```bash
     modman clone git://github.com/EcomDev/EcomDev_PHPUnit.git 
     ```
    * Add extension as dependency in your composer.json to install it from [Magento Composer Repository](http://packages.firegento.com/)
      ```json
      {
            "require": {
               "ecomdev/ecomdev_phpunit": "*"
            }
      }
      ```

3. Open your terminal and navigate to your magento directory for performing the following command, they are required to configure system for running the test suite 
    ```bash
    # Shell scripts needs to be run from this directory
    cd $YOUR_MAGENTO_DIRECTORY/shell 
    # Specify your test database name and base url for controller tests
    php ecomdev-phpunit.php -a magento-config --db-name $DB_NAME --base-url http://your.magento.url/
    ```
    If you receive a warning on PHPUnit checks for optional packages, run the following command
    ```bash
    php ecomdev-phpunit.php -a fix-autoloader
    ```

4. Run the unit tests first time for installing test database. It will take about 3 minutes.

        $ phpunit 

5. If it shows that there was no tests found, it means that extension was successfully installed. If it shows some errors, then it means, that your customizations has install scripts that relay on your current database data and you should fix them. Or use your dev database as a base for the tests, but prior first time running the suite.
